# Raw platform

This servers as my self-written tutorial on how to set-up webpack and nodejs so that you can work on front-end and back-end at the same time easily, besides this template (which will be developed into a simple platform) also integrates **ReactJS** and **Hot Module Replacement** (all built totally from scratch).

Why such a combination?

It's just to facillitate the process of write/update a dynamic website without much distraction from the world outside. NodeJS enables the routing and databases as well as all the requests to server, while webpack makes our life a lot easier with front-end dev. Besides, who doesn't want fluid experiences with
React (no need to go to browser to refresh the pages everytime something is changed, and if reloading the page is too long, it's only reloaded partially, just wonderful!).
